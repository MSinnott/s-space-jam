# s-space-jam
Music generator -- creates music from a variety of sources

Currently procedurally generates music, generates a sound file based on a function

Multi-document interface allows for editing and viewing of an audio file; gives fine control over the raw sound data

Entire project runs in under 1G RAM; can do a FFT on a full (2+ min) song within 1G

How to use:
The project is currently an Intellij project, so it can only be used through the IDE. However, it will become a packaged JAR file that can be run on any upstanding JVM

We have a website! It too is a work in progress, so check back for updates on both facets of the project.
