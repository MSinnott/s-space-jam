		<p>Welcome to S Space Jam's website!</p>
		<p>S Space Jam hopes to deliver a computerized song generator. The idea is to take music that you personally enjoy, break them down into their most basic components, and create a completely new track that has elements similar to those of uploaded tracks.</p>
